## **Stopwatch Application (Built with Next.js)**
The Stopwatch Application is a time-tracking tool designed to help users measure elapsed time. Built with **Next.js**, this application provides a dynamic and interactive stopwatch with start, pause, and reset functionality. Leveraging React's power within the Next.js framework, the app offers a fast, efficient, and user-friendly interface for time tracking.

### **Objectives**
✔️ Create a responsive, interactive stopwatch that works seamlessly across devices.  
✔️ Allow users to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch.  
✔️ Display time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds format.  
✔️ Ensure optimal performance and user experience using Next.js's server-side rendering features.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Next.js**: Framework used to build the React-based application, ensuring fast performance and easy routing.
- **React**: Provides the components and state management for the stopwatch.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS or custom styles)**: For a clean and responsive UI design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the stopwatch logic (start, pause, reset) and dynamic time updates.

---

### **How It Works (Step by Step)**

1️⃣ **Start the Stopwatch**  
   - The user clicks the "Start" button, which triggers the JavaScript logic to start the stopwatch.
   - Next.js renders the stopwatch UI, and JavaScript initiates a timer with `setInterval`, updating every 10 milliseconds.

2️⃣ **Pause the Stopwatch**  
   - When the user clicks the "Pause" button, JavaScript stops the timer by clearing the interval.
   - The stopwatch halts at the current time.

3️⃣ **Reset the Stopwatch**  
   - Clicking the "Reset" button resets the time to zero and pauses the stopwatch if it's running.

4️⃣ **Time Display**  
   - Time is displayed in `MM:SS:MS` format (minutes, seconds, milliseconds) as the stopwatch runs.
   - Each update is reflected in real-time by React's state changes.

5️⃣ **Styling and Layout**  
   - The interface is styled using **Tailwind CSS** (or custom CSS), ensuring it is attractive and responsive.
   - The layout is designed to be flexible, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes.
